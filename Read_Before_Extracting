(ALL GAMES ARE PRE-INSTALLED, YOU JUST NEED TO EXRACT AND RUN, SOMETIMES :3)

HOW TO RUN A GAME:
——————————————————————

1. Turn OFF your Antivirus and/or Windows Defender before you extract the game. ## this is for windows installation, do not install this on linux/mac unless using wine, yw ^^ <3 ##

2. All the programs in the _CommonRedist folder must be installed to run a game. ## don't manually click them, they will automatically install once game is extracted and ran, yw <3 ##

3. Extract the game in the drive where you want to keep it. ## recommended put it in a folder on desktop, again yw <3 ##

4. Navigate to the '.exe' file of the game and Run it as an Administrator.
Note: The exe file will be the game launcher file. ## click the game twice, yw again <3 ##

5. Its mandatory otherwise it will not run or save progress. ## don't create shortcut ##

P.S: DON'T, AND I MEAN IT, DON'T RENAME ANY FILES IN THIS FOLDER, EVEN THE FOLDER NAME, IT WILL BREAK THE INSTALLATION, yw ^^
